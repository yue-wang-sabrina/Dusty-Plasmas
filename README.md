# Dusty-Plasmas
Msci Project Imperial College London

run main_dust.py to create video of dusty plasma generation --> release onto plane subject to internal electric field of the shieth to arrange
in crystalline structure --> application of magnetic field which generates void and rotation.

run main_ion.py to generate plot of simulated drift of ions vs elapsed time.

run main_gibson.py to plot regions accessoble to electrons with B field presence.

Code is translate to C++ (see dustyplasma_cpp folder)

Code can also be controlled by GUI (see gui folder) : this may be problematic as there are still minor bug fixes to be made.
