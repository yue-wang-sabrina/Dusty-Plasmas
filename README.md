# Dusty-Plasmas
Msci Project Imperial College London

run main_dust.py to create video of dusty plasma generation --> release onto plane subject to internal electric field of the shieth to arrange
in crystalline structure --> application of magnetic field which generates void and rotation.

run main_ion.py to generate plot of simulated drift of ions vs elapsed time.

run main_gibson.py to plot regions accessoble to electrons with B field presence.
